##### Explain the necessary steps you did to make the code testable, and some of the patterns involved in this step 
 
 Refactoring
 
 
 1) Step
 
###### Refactor DateFormatter

*Before*
 
In the original code a new Date object was instantiated inside the method which violated single responsibility pattern.
It didn't make use of Polymorphism and it ha a static method


*The basic issue with static methods is they are procedural code. I have no idea how to unit-test procedural code. Unit-testing assumes that I can instantiate a piece of my application in isolation. During the instantiation I wire the dependencies with mocks/friendlies which replace the real dependencies.* [source](http://misko.hevery.com/2008/12/15/static-methods-are-death-to-testability/)
 
*After*

 A interface IDateFormatter has a non static method that inject a Date instance.
The DateFromatter implements the interface.

###### Refactor JokeFetcher
By using polymorphism for JokeFetcher and EduJoke, Moma, Chuck, and Tambal implement the interface IJokeFetcher.
Each IJokeFetcher implemetation contains the different logic for fetching the joke from the API.


FetcherFactory implements IFetcherFactory interface.

The difference IJokeFetcher are instantiated with FetcherFactory that uses the Factory Method Pattern.

The Factory Method Pattern is used because logic is required for instancing the IJokeFetcher types. This pattern implements this logic and returns the right types,

###### JUnit
 *Is:*
 
 JUnit is a unit testing framework for Java programming language. It plays a crucial role test-driven development, and is a family of unit testing frameworks collectively known as xUnit. [source](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/junit/junit_overview.htm)
 JUnit is a simple, open source framework to write and run repeatable tests. It is an instance of the xUnit architecture for unit testing frameworks. JUnit features include:

Assertions for testing expected results
Test fixtures for sharing common test data
Test runners for running tests
JUnit was originally written by Erich Gamma and Kent Beck. [source](https://junit.org/junit4/faq.html#overview_1)
 

 
 *Solves problem for testers:*
 
 It is a tool for writing automated test against code.
 It is also a tool used in TDD. It aids the programmer to write the test against his own code. So coding and testing can be done by the same developer.
 There is huge cost benefits in discovering bugs early in the development of code.
 
###### Hamcrest
  *Is:*
  
  Hamcrest. Matchers that can be combined to create flexible expressions of intent.
  
  *Solves problem for testers:*
  
  Extends the JUnit library with more flexibility and more readable tests.
  
  
###### Mockito
  *Is:*
  
  Mockito is a mocking framework. It lets you write beautiful tests with a clean & simple API. Mockito is the most popular mocking tool for Java. 
  
  *Solves problem for testers:*
  
  *Java mocking is dominated by expect-run-verify libraries like EasyMock or jMock. Mockito offers simpler and more intuitive approach: you ask questions about interactions after execution. Using mockito, you can verify what you want. Using expect-run-verify libraries you are often forced to look after irrelevant interactions.

No expect-run-verify also means that Mockito mocks are often ready without expensive setup upfront. They aim to be transparent and let the developer to focus on testing selected behavior rather than absorb attention.

Mockito has very slim API, almost no time is needed to start mocking. There is only one kind of mock, there is only one way of creating mocks. Just remember that stubbing goes before execution, verifications of interactions go afterwards. You'll soon notice how natural is that kind of mocking when TDD-ing java code.* [soyrce](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/wiki/Features-And-Motivations)
  
  
###### Jacoco
  *Is:*
 
 JaCoCo â€“ a code coverage reports generator for Java projects.
 
  *Solves problem for testers:*

##### Demonstrate how you used Mockito to mock away external Dependencies 


##### Demonstrate how/where you did state-based testing and how/where you did behavior based testing

*State based testing is when you exercise one or many methods of an object and then assert the expected state of the object.*


*Behavior based testing is when you expect specific interactions to occur between objects when certain methods are executed. Behavior based testers (Mockists) utilize mocks to verify expected interaction between objects of a system. Behavior based testing is about specifying how the system should behave rather than specifying the expected result of running the system.*








##### Explain about Coverage Criterias, using the results presented by running Jacoco (or a similar tool) against you final test code. 

*Simply put, code coverage is a way of ensuring that your tests are actually testing your code. 
When you run your tests you are presumably checking that you are getting the expected results. 
Code coverage will tell you how much of your code you exercised by running the test. 
Your tests may all pass with flying colours, but if you've only tested 50% of your code, how much confidence can you have in it?*
